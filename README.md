# ch7simpleStats

There is a project named SimpleStat in Program 7-8 in this chapter (in section 7.8, private member functions). Implement that program. Add another function to find the smallest of the numbers entered. Display the count of the numbers, the sum of the numbers, the largest number, the smallest number, and the average.

Here is an example of the output:

![Ch 7 Simple Stats](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch7simpleStats/blob/main/stats8.PNG)

Create a table of test cases BEFORE you write and run your project to calculate the correct results for 3 different groups of numbers. Use a different number of numbers as well as different values in each test case. Run the project with input matching those test cases and check your results. Take screenshots of the result of running the project for each test case.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases, AND the root folder for the project.




== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
